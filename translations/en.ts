  description:
    "Inspired by Arthur Aron's self-disclosure methodology, this questionnaire is designed to deepen self-reflection and interpersonal discourse on the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in our lives. The questions progress from the individual (egosystem) to the collective (ecosystem), from the present to the future, and even the past. The goal is to explore perceptions of AI from a fundamental level to an existential one.",
